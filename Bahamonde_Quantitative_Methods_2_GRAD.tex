\subsection*{Overview and Objectives}

\emph{What is the influence of income on the probability of voting? Is there any systematic relationship between democracy and trade? Is it true that correlation does not imply causation?} To consider these kind of statements in a rigorous way, we will learn a technique called \emph{ordinary least regression}, the workhorse of applied quantitative methodology in social sciences. Additionally, the course provides in-depth, hands-on training in statistical techniques and research methodologies used across the social and behavioral sciences. At the end of the course you will become an educated consumer and producer of quantitative analysis.
\\
\\
This {\bf {\color{blue}graduate-level course}} offers an introduction to linear models in political science. This course will hopefully prepare you for the things you will encounter when you (attempt to) publish quantitative work with linear models. This course will provide you with a systematic approach to assessing, fixing and presenting your linear model results. Though we focus almost exclusively on linear models, some nonlinear models will also be introduced. 
\\
\\
During the semester, we will focus on a number of assumptions, applications, violations to those assumptions, and their corresponding solutions. It is the intention of this course to be both theoretically relevant and practically oriented at the same time. As you will quickly realize, you will ``learn by doing.'' Besides learning quantitative methodology, you will also learn a number of computer skills, mainly {\bf R} and \LaTeX. Therefore, if you are not already with those tools, try to be patient with your self.
\\
\\
I hope this course catches your attention, in the expectation that you continue taking more methods and/or computing courses. Most of all, I hope you see how applied statistics are both an art and a science. {\bf Welcome!}



\subsection*{Methodology}

This is a 42-hours {\bf {\color{blue}independent study}} which will take place between the weeks of {\bf July 2} and {\bf August 20}. In these {\bf 8 weeks}, the student will meet the professor {\bf twice a week}. Each meeting will cover one item from the schedule \autoref{schedule}.  Since there are 16 topics to be covered, they will be distributed in 8 weeks, in $\frac{16}{8}=2$ weekly meetings. Each meeting will last 2.5 hours. 2.5 hours $\times$ 2 weekly meetings $\times$ 8 weeks $=$ 40 hours. There are two hours to spare during the 8-weeks period, which will be used to solve additional questions, and computational issues. The emphasis of each meeting will cover both the assigned readings, and the applied-computational components. During the meetings, applied examples will be given, particularly, regarding applications to political science. 



\subsection*{Prerequisites}


There are no formal prerequisites for this course. Only good predisposition to learn and spend quality-time doing the readings and problem sets. That said, basic math, calculus, probability and linear algebra is assumed at the level covered in any ``Math Camp,'' or equivalently at the level of \emph{Essential Mathematics for Political and Social Research} (Gill, 2006).


\subsection*{Software}

It is not enough to just \emph{read} about statistics. The best way to learn applied statistics is by \emph{doing}. For this reason, in this course you will sit in the driving seat and actually estimate (a lot of) statistical models using {\bf R}. {\bf R} is free and compatible with essentially all kinds of machines. One of {\bf R}'s main virtues from the grad-student point of view is that the base package and all of the add-ons (called ``packages'' in {\bf R}) are free. You can download the base package of R from the \emph{Comprehensive R Archive Network} (\emph{CRAN}) \href{http://www.cran.r-project.org}{website}.  

You can find a virtually endless set of resources for {\bf R} on the Internet, including this \href{http://scs.math.yorku.ca/index.php/R:_Getting_started_with_R}{Getting Started With R} page. If you are completely new to {\bf R}, you should complete this online short course, \href{http://tryr.codeschool.com/}{Try R}. Finally, I suggest a {\bf R} interphase called \texttt{RStudio}. \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{RStudio} makes {\bf R} easier to use. It includes a code editor, debugging and visualization tools.
\\
\\
Quantitative methodology is not only about estimating the ``best'' model (if such a thing even exists) but also about presenting your results in an effective way. For this reason, all problem sets and final presentations should be carried out in \LaTeX. \LaTeX\, is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. \LaTeX\, is the \emph{de facto} standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. Download the last version \href{https://www.latex-,roject.org/get/}{here}.
\\
\\
You are free to use other softwares such as \texttt{STATA}, \texttt{MathLab}, \texttt{SAS}, etc. However, I might provide assistance only for the former. That said, all in-class examples are going to be taught in {\bf R}, which is by far the most common statistical tool nowadays.

	\item[$\bullet$] Fox, John and Sanford Weisberg. (2011) An R Companion to Applied Regression. 2nd ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Course Learning Objectives}
 
Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\bullet$] Acquire an understanding of the main tools related to linear regression.
	\item[$\bullet$] Use the linear method up to the point where you feel comfortable doing analysis in your own research.
	\item[$\bullet$] Consume \emph{critically} methodological-oriented literature.
\end{itemize}






\subsection*{Requirements and Evaluations}

\begin{enumerate}

	% midterm
	\item {\bf Student Project, \underline{Date}}: 50 \%. 
	\\
	\\
	An empirical paper that applies methods learned in this class to a research question of their choice. The paper should be 10-15 pages in length and focus on the research question, data, empirical strategy, results, and conclusions. Literature reviews, background, lengthy motivations, etc. should be omitted or may be included as an appendix. 
	\\
	\\
	You should be able to convince me that your empirical strategy is solid. For that, you should provide graphs, tables, robustness checks, among other tools. 
	\\
	\\
	The paper should be very clear about the kind of model used, and it should use proper mathematical notation. The paper should be written in \LaTeX. Documents in \emph{Word} will not be accepted.
	\\
	\\
	You also need to submit a copy of your {\bf R} code. I should be able to replicate your exact results. That is, I should be able to hit ``run'' in \emph{RStudio} and obtain the exact same output. Failure to replicate your results will discount points out of grade.
	\\
	\\
	Students are free to choose any topic they want. As long as it has a strong data-analytical component, it's fine by me. I strongly advice you to get the data in advance. As you will quickly realize, the real world does not work as when you do homeworks, e.g. the data you will originally find, will be messy, with lots of inconsistencies, variables will not be labeled, among other programs. My advice: \emph{start early}. One alternative I propose is to find a dataset that interests \emph{you} in the \href{https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/access/subject.jsp}{ICPSR repository}.


	% essay
	\item {\bf Problem Sets, \underline{Date}}: 30\%. 
	\\
	\\
	This is a methodological course, developing skills in understanding and applying statistical methods. You can only learn statistics by doing statistics and therefore the homework for this course is extensive, including weekly homework assignments. The assignments consist of analytical problems, computer simulations, and data analysis. 
	\\
	\\
	In this section you will learn how to recode a variable, merge datasets, summarize variables, plot a distribution, among other more theoretical issues. And while we will not focus on mathematical proofs, you will spend time thinking about and working on the mechanics of linear regression.


	\item {\bf Final Exam}: 20 \%. 
	\\
	\\
	There will be a single, take-home final exam in the course that will require that you apply the knowledge gained in the course to particular methodological problem. The format of the exam will be discussed by the end of the semester. However, you can expect the test to be an exercise in guided replication and primarily involves data analysis and interpretation.	Exam questions will be drawn both from the readings and lectures. The final exam is set by the registrar. Hence, both place and time are TBA. There will not be exceptions. We will also schedule an in-class review session for {\bf date}. 

\end{enumerate}




\subsection*{Grading}

This course will be grade according to the following scale: 
A: $\geq$ 93, A-: 90-92, B+: 87-89, B: 83-86, B-: 80-82, C+: 77-79, C:73-76, C-: 70-72, D+: 67-69, D:63-66, D-: 60-62, and F: $\leq$ 59. 

\subsection*{Disputing Grades}

I am happy to go over any exam or paper with you. Request for re-grading, though, must be done in writing. Please refer to my \href{https://github.com/hbahamonde/hbahamonde.github.io/raw/master/resources/ReGrade_Policy.pdf}{re-grading policy}.



\subsection*{Academic Integrity}
In accordance with Tulane University policy on Academic Integrity, you are expected to fully comply with the school's \href{https://college.tulane.edu/code-of-academic-conduct}{\texttt{policies}}. 


\subsection*{Students with Disabilities}
Students with disabilities who require accommodation should check with the \href{https://accessibility.tulane.edu/}{\texttt{Goldman Center for Student Accessibility}}.


\subsection*{Absence from Exams}


There will be no make-up exams unless you have a \emph{documented} {\bf medical} emergency. If at all possible, I need to be notified before the exam of your inability to take it. Absence from an exam because of travel plans will not be excused. Make travel plans accordingly. 


\subsection*{Office Hours}

I have an open-doors policy, feel free to stop by my office at any time. However, you might want to minimize the risks that I am not there, or can't meet you that day. I advice you then to \href{https://calendly.com/bahamonde/officehours}{\texttt{schedule time with me}} using my automatic scheduler. I think fixed office hours do not work because ... well, they are \emph{fixed}. I prefer flexibility. Hence, you can see me any day/time that's available during the week. Do not send me a reminder as I will receive an alert: If the time spot is available, I am happy to see you there.



\subsection*{Schedule\label{schedule}}
